## Seeding and Sorting Overview

Seeders and Sorters canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's webcrawler. If the URLs are crawlable, the Seeders/Sorters nominate them to the End-of-Term (EOT) project, otherwise they add them to the Uncrawlable spreadsheet using the project's Chrome Extension.

## Choosing the website
The Seeders/Sorters team will use the EDGI subprimer systems ([found here](https://envirodatagov.org/agency-forecasts/)), or a similar set of resources, to identify important/at risk data. Talk to the DataRescue organizers to learn more.

## Canvassing the website and evaluating content
- Start exploring the website assigned, identifying important URLs. 
- Decide whether their data on a page or website subsection can be [automatically captured by the Internet Archive webcrawler](./what-heritrix-does.md).
- The best source of information about the seeding and sorting process is represented at [https://envirodatagov.org/](https://envirodatagov.org/).

## Crawlable URLs 
- URLs judged to be possibly crawlable are "nominated" (equivalently, "seeded") to the End-Of-Term project (EOT), using the [EDGI Nomination Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nominationtool/abjpihafglmijnkkoppbookfkkanklok?hl=en) or

## Uncrawlable URLs 
 - If URL is judged not crawlable, add it to the "Uncrawlable" spreadsheet through the Chrome Extension. 
  - In the spreadsheet is automatically associated with a universal unique identifyer (UUID) that was generated in advance. 

## Not sure?
 - This sorting is only provisional: when in doubt seeders mark a URL as possibly not crawlable, and these URLs populate a spreadsheet.
