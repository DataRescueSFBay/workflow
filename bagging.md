# BAGGING

- When getting started as a Bagger
  - Get set up with Python and the Python script to make a bag at the command line https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python
  - Get set up wit the app http://drp-upload-bagger.herokuapp.com/
    - This include getting an account for the app and being vetted for the Bagger role.
  - Contact your DataRescue Coordinator, if you need any assistance.

- Claiming a dataset for bagging 
  - You will work on datasets that were last handled by Checkers. 
  - Go to the Unscrawlable spreadsheet, and look for a dataset that has the status "Bagger status indicator" = Closed
  - Claim it by entering your slack handle with the status "Open" and the date in the cell "Bagger status indicator" in Bagger section, for instance: 
  ```
  @khdelphine open 1/22/2017
  ```
  
- Downloading & opening the dataset
  - Go to the URL containing the zipped dataset (in cell "URL from upload of zip", in the Harvester section) 
  - Download the zip file to your laptop, and unzip it.
  - Quality assurance: spot check to ensure the UUID and downloaded materials match to the spreadsheet row
  
- Creating the Json file
  - Take folder and create metadata folder for Json template.
  - Label the json file and the folder where it is located with the entry's UUID (see column "Unique ID").
  - The json should use the following format:

  ```
  {
    "Individual source or seed URL": "http://www.eia.gov/renewable/data.cfm",
    "UUID" : "E30FA3CA-C5CB-41D5-8608-0650D1B6F105",
    "id_agency" : 2,
    "id_subagency": ,
    "id_org":,
    "id_suborg":,
    "Institution facilitating the data capture creation and packaging": "Penn Data Refuge",
    "Date of capture": "2017-01-17",
    "Federal agency data acquired from": "Department of Energy/U.S. Energy Information Administration",
    "Name of resource": "Renewable and Alternative Fuels",
    "File formats contained in package": ".pdf, .zip",
    "Type(s) of content in package": "datasets, codebooks",
    "Free text description of capture process": "Metadata was generated by viewing page and using spreadsheet descriptions where necessary, data was bulk downloaded from the page using wget -r on the seed URL and then bagged.",
    "Name of package creator": "Mallick Hossain and Ben Goldman"
    }
  ```
  - Make sure to save this as a .json file.
  - Copy the metadata file into folder where the package is

- Creating the bag
  - Run python command line script which creates the bag

  ```
  bagit.py --contact-name '[your name]' /directory/to/bag
  ```

  - You should be left with a 'data' folder (which contains the downloaded content and metadata file) and four separate bagit files
    - bag-info.txt
    - bagit.txt
    - manifest-md5.txt
    - tagmanifest-md5.txt

- Creating the Zip file and uploading it 
  - Zip this entire collection (data folder and bagit files) and confirm that it is named with the row's UUID
  - Upload the zipped bag using the application http://drp-upload-bagger.herokuapp.com/
    - Note that files beyond 5 Gigs cannot be uploaded through this method
    -   Please talk to your DataRescue coordinator, if you have a larger file
    
- Quality assurance and finishing up
  - To ensure that the bag was uploaded successfully, go to the URL and download the bag back to your laptop. 
  - Unzip it, open it and spot check to make sure that the bag looks well formed and the files seem valid.
  - In the Uncrawlable spreadsheet, change the status to "Closed" in the cell "Bagger status indicator", for instance: 
  ```
  @khdelphine closed 1/22/2017
  ```
    - If ever a day or more passed between since you originally claimed the item, update the date to today's date. 
    - Note that if more than 2 days have passed since you claimed the dataset and it is still not closed, someone else can claim it in your place and start working on it
      - This will avoid datasets being stuck in the middle of the workflow and not being finalized.
